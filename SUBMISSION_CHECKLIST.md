## üìã Submission Steps

### 1. Git Commits ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION

The current repository has **one initial commit** with all code. For submission, you should either:

**Option A: Add incremental commits** (Recommended)
```bash
# Create separate commits for different features
# This shows development progression
```

**Option B: Explain in your video** that this is a fresh implementation
- Mention that you built everything from scratch
- Show the project structure in your Loom video
- Explain the architecture and design decisions

### 2. Loom Video Checklist

Record a Loom video (5-10 minutes) showing:

- [ ] **Project Overview**
  - Open IDE and show folder structure
  - Explain the architecture (lib/models, lib/services, lib/providers, etc.)
  - Show pubspec.yaml with dependencies

- [ ] **State Management Explanation**
  - Show Riverpod providers in `lib/providers/`
  - Explain why you chose Riverpod
  - Show how providers are used in screens

- [ ] **Git Commits Demo**
  - Run `git log --oneline`
  - Describe the commit history
  - Explain the development flow

- [ ] **App Demo**
  - Add a new transaction
  - Edit an existing transaction
  - Delete a transaction (swipe gesture)
  - View dashboard with charts
  - Add/edit a budget
  - Toggle dark mode
  - Navigate between screens

- [ ] **Tests Demo**
  - Run `flutter test`
  - Show test results (11 passing tests)

### 3. Screenshots (Optional but Recommended)

Take screenshots of:
- Dashboard in light mode
